## 3. Why I built this :hammer:
This was a part of the web development course I'm currently in‚Äîa code-along project. I gave it a shot on my own initially, got some bits working. Later, I checked out the tutor's code-along video, built it with them, and then took another swing at it solo..


## 4. what I learned building this project.
- I picked up skills on assembling different JavaScript code elements to construct an app. Here's a breakdown:

- Employing variables to store user input via the prompt method.

- Mastering the creation of game loops using the while loop, where the code within it persists until the expressions evaluate to false, allowing the program to run until you decide to quit.

- Utilizing conditionals to design programs with branching logic based on user input.

- Applying for loops to display array content based on user input.

- Updating an array with user input, such as adding new items to the end using the push method.

- Deleting items from the array based on user input, accomplished through the splice method.
