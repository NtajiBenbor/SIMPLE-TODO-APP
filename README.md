## 3. Why I built this :hammer:
I undertook this project as a personal challenge to assess my grasp of the Bootstrap CSS framework learned from Colt Steele's Udemy course. It was a venture I wanted to tackle independently, devoid of any guidance, where problem-solving was entirely on my shoulders. Admittedly, I hit some roadblocks, but I persisted, overcoming challenges and successfully bringing the project to fruition.


## 4. what I learned building this project.
- The use of CSS frameworks like this significantly streamlines the process of writing custom CSS, saving considerable time and effort.

- **Utilizing Bootstrap's component classes:** I became quite adept at employing Bootstrap's component class system to effortlessly translate intricate designs.

- **Mastering Bootstrap's Grid system:** Discovering a tool that effortlessly enables users to address responsiveness through its column and row classes forming the grid system was a revelation. This allowed me to craft a website that appeared appealing on various screen sizes.

- **Creating seamless, responsive navbars:** Crafting navigation bars with CSS has never been this straightforward. I successfully designed an aesthetically pleasing, responsive navbar using just a few classes.

- **Mastering documentation navigation:** A valuable lesson Bootstrap imparts, particularly for novice web developers, is the cultivation of a culture of diligently reading through documentation. Over time, it teaches you how to effectively reference the documentation to locate the information you need.

- **Efficiency with Utility classes:** Utility classes prove to be time-saving superheroes, enabling us to make minor adjustments to our elements without resorting to verbose and sometimes unnecessary CSS code.
